Revision history for Perl extension Class::Delegator.

      - Fixed a few more minor typos.
      - Added #line comments to the generated delegation methods that point to
        the context in which Class::Delegator was used. This makes debugging
        easier, as any exceptions will have an appropriate file name and line
        number rather than "at (eval 137) line 1". Patch from Sterling
        Hanenkamp.
      - Added meethod name information to the delegating methods, by assigning
        the method name to *__ANON__.

      - Added support for dispatching a single method call to multiple
        attributes. The "as" parameter can be used to dispatch to different
        methods in those multiple attributes. This brings things more in
        line with how Class::Delegation works.
      - Added a "Benchmarks" section to demonstrate the performance of
        Class::Delegator vs. Class::Delegation and manually-generated
        delegation methods.
      - When specified as an array reference, the "as" parameter no longer
        needs to contain the same number of items as the "send" parameter. But
        it does need to be the same number of items as in the "to" parameter
        when both "to" and "as" are array references.
